This repository contains Python programs to perform various image processing operations. The assignment includes the following tasks:
1. Reduce the number of intensity levels in an image from 256 to 2, in integer powers of 2. 
2. Load an image and then perform a simple spatial 3x3 average of image pixels and processed continued for a 10x10 neighborhood and again for a 20x20 neighborhood.
3. Rotate an image by 45 and 90 degrees.
4. For every 3×3 block of the image (without overlapping), replace all corresponding 9 pixels by their average. This operation simulates reducing the image spatial resolution. process is repeated for 5×5 blocks and 7×7 blocks.
These all tasks has been done for "horse.jpg" image.
